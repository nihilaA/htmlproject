FAMILY

For me my family is,
What I can't explain in simple words.
If I say that's my world, then
Definitely it's the happiest planet
With the most shining
Natural satellites!

LOVE CHASE

As we search love,
We lose our value unknowingly.
Be worthy enough.
Let your love chase you
And find you!


DARKNESS

When darkness entered my life
I felt the beauty of the moon
And understood that, 
Every morning would be 
Incomplete Without the sun 
And every night would be
Meaningless without the
Single moonâ€¦



MOON- THE SECRET KEEPER

When I share my secrets with moon,
I don't get afraid of treachery.
Because, the moon only receives 
The secret and don't reveal it.


WISH ON SOMEDAYS

On someday, I wish for
Someone, who stays by my side,
Just to say "Everything will be OKAY"! 


NIGHT

The night is afraid of
Being surrounded by silence
And stolen by loneliness.


RETURN

If you move on from a place with SHAME,
Then make sure, you should return to the same place with FAME.

MASTERPIECE

The moon is a piece of art,
In this universe. But,
It's the masterpiece of an 
Unknown artist who made
The people to fall in love
With it's astounding beauty.
